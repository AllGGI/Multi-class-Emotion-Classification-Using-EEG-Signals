# Multi-class-Emotion-Classification-Using-EEG-Signals
## Abstract
Recently, the availability of large EEGdatasets, advancements in Brain-Computer interface(BCI) systems and Machine Learning have led to the implementation of deep learning architectures, especially in the analysis of emo- tions using EEG signals. These signals can be generated by the user while per- forming various mental, emotional and physical tasks thus, reflecting the brain functionality. Extracting the important feature values from these unprocessed sig- nals remain a vital step in the deployment. Fast Fourier Transformation proves to be better than the traditional feature extraction techniques. In this paper we have compared the deep learning models namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on 80-20 and 75-25Train-Test splits. The best result was obtained from LSTM classifier with an accuracy of 88.6% on the liking emotion. CNN also gave a good accuracy of87.72% due to its capability to extract spatial feature from the input signals. Thus, both these models are quite beneficial in this context.
